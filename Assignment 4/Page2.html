<p> Portugal is a tiny country on the most western part of Europe. Portugal is famous for its beaches, food and most importantly Cristiano Ronaldo. Stop by Porto, to see the library that inspired Harry Potter and take a boat ride on the Rio Douro to see amazing landscapes like the photo to the left. Next stop is Aveiro, the Venice of Portugal. You can't forget to stop at Lisbon, the country's capital. Here you can see some of the many castles and eat an amazing pastel de Belem! The last stop is Lagos! Here you can find the most amazing beaches and rock formations. If you are a nature lover, make the Azores islands a priority. The beautiful greenery and many volcanos is a must see.  </p>

                  <p> I have lost count of how many times I have visited Portugal. My family is from Portugal so I have been going every other year from the time I was born. The photo to the right is a picture of my mom's small town of Castelo Do Neiva. There are mountains to the east and both the river and the ocean to the west. This photo specifically is where the river meets the ocean. Since my family is from the north of Portugal, I have spent alot of time in cities like Viana do Castelo and Porto. The north of Portugal has lots of historical buildings, churches and castles. The place I have not seen but hope to go soon the islands of Azores. The Azores is a collective of 9 islands with tons of beautiful landscapes, hot springs and mountains. Portugal is my happy place.  </p>
