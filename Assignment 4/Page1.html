            <p> <strong> About Me! </strong> </p>
            <p> Hello! My name is Sara. I am a 22 year old business student at Brock University. My biggest passion is traveling. Exploring new countries and learning about new cultures is so exciting. Over the years I have travelled to a few countries. These include, Portugal, Spain, Cuba, France, England, Dominican Republic and many more! I have created this blog to share the experiences and tips that I have learned from my years of travel.  </p>

          <p> <strong> Sara's Cost Saving Travel Tips </strong> </p>
          <p> To save a little extra money during your travels, make sure to follow some of these tips! The first is to rent Airbnbs rather than hotels. These are more cost effective and the options are endless. Next, travel during off seasons as accomodation and flights are much cheaper. Lastly, eat meals and stay in Airbnbs in the outskirts of the cities you visit. Prices in the city center are always more expensive. </p>
